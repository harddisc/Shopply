Clarence loves to discover new topics, especially when he is surfing the web. One challenge he encounters on a
regular basis, is he finds it hard to identify what a page is talking about, without reading the whole page. The other
challenge Clarence faces is he loves sharing great pages he finds with his friends on Facebook, but finds it
cumbersome to switch to Facebook to copy and paste the page URL into Facebook, and then add a small message.

The extension of Chrome helps to achieve it.
